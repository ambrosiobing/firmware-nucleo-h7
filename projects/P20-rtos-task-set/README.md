# P20: Three jobs at once: the node as an RTOS application

Status: c=none cpp=none python=none rust=none

**Not started.** This directory exists so the shape of the volume is visible
from the start rather than arriving a project at a time. Nothing here runs yet.

**What it is.** P08 to P12 rebuilt as a statically allocated task set, with a latency distribution over a million events against a deadline stated in advance.

**What it needs on the bench.** Nucleo plus the IKS4A1

**What has to come first.** P01 owns the cross toolchain file, the startup code
and the linker script, so nothing in this repository can be flashed until that
project exists. As of Thursday 1 October 2026 win11 aquamarine has no
`arm-none-eabi-gcc`, no flashing tool and no `ninja`, so the target half of every
project here is blocked on a download rather than on a question.

Chapter 20 of [the book][book] is the written design. When work starts here it
follows that chapter's acceptance criteria, and anything the chapter leaves as
"not measured" is either measured or still says so.
